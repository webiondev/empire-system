                <p>Business accounting consists of three basic activities: identifying, recording and communicating the economic events of a company. Accountants identify economic events such as transactions and investments. Accountants use bookkeeping techniques to systematically record economic events. Finally, accountants use financial statements to present their records to people who use accounting information. Sometimes, accounting might also mean analyzing and interpreting financial statements and explaining the meaning of reported data.</p>
