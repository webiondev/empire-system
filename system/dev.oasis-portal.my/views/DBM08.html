                <p>Business communication is a specialized branch of general communication that is specifically concerned with business activities. Generally, when communication takes place between or among parties regarding business-related functions, it can be termed as business communication. But the process, methods, types, principles etc. remain almost same with those of general communication and the basic difference lies in their areas of application. </p>
<p>Business communication can be of two types internal and external. When communication occurs within the same organization, it is called internal business communication and itâ€™s related to maintaining and improving the morale of employees, procedures and prescribing methods, directing the workers, keeping the management informed and announcing policies and organizational changes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when communication occurs between and among people belonging to different business organizations, it is called external business communication. External communication is related to selling and obtaining goods and services, maintaining liaison with concerned parties, reporting to different parties etc.
